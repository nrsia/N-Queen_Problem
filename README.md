# N-Queen Problem using Hill Climbing Algorithm:-
For the N-Queen problem, I have utilized the Hill Climbing algorithm with random neighbor selection to find a solution. The Hill Climbing algorithm is a local search algorithm that starts with a random state and iteratively moves to the neighboring states with higher values, eventually reaching a peak. You can review the implementation and details of the Hill Climbing algorithm  attached below.
